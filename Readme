## StoryAI: UI Description

StoryAI presents a clean, professional, and modern user interface, heavily influenced by Google's design language. It features a primary color palette of white and light grays, accented by shades of teal for interactive elements and calls to action. The typography, using the 'Poppins' font, is crisp and readable.

1.  **Header:**
    *   A fixed header at the top displays the "StoryAI" logo (an image `ybai-removebg-preview.png`) on the left.
    *   On the right, users find:
        *   A style icon (a 3x3 grid of dots) which, when clicked, reveals a dropdown panel (`apps-grid`) listing app-like sections: "Story Progress," "History," and "Prompt Library."
        *   A circular profile avatar (displaying an initial or uploaded image). Clicking this opens a "profile Account" style dropdown (`profile-dropdown`) showing the user's email, a larger profile picture with an option to change it, a greeting ("Hi, Priyam!"), a "Sign out" link, and links to "Privacy Policy" & "Terms of Service."
    *   Both dropdowns feature a subtle blur effect on the content behind them.

2.  **Breadcrumbs:**
    *   Below the header, a breadcrumb navigation bar appears when on the "Story Page," indicating the path (e.g., "Story > Your Story Title").

3.  **Main Content Area:** The application is page-based, with different views for different functions:
    *   **Idea Page (`#idea-page`):** This is the primary landing/creation page.
        *   A prominent heading asks, "What's your story idea?" followed by a descriptive paragraph.
        *   A central input area includes:
            *   A "Choose a Category" dropdown (e.g., Digital Adventure, Fantasy Quest).
            *   A Google-style search bar with a microphone icon for voice input and the placeholder "Describe your story idea here...". A paper plane icon on the right acts as the submit button.
    *   **Story Page (`#story-page`):**
        *   A "Back to Idea Page" button.
        *   The main story title.
        *   A "Download Story as PDF" button.
        *   The `story-output` section dynamically displays generated story scenes. Each scene typically has an image and corresponding text, with an alternating layout (image left, text right, then image right, text left).
        *   If a story isn't found, a "No story found" message with an illustrative GIF is shown.
    *   **Profile Page (`#profile-page`):**
        *   Allows users to view and edit their name.
        *   Displays their email (read-only).
        *   Features a large profile picture display with a "Change Photo" button (triggering a file upload).
        *   Buttons to "Save Changes" and "Change Password."
    *   **Content Pages (`#privacy-policy-page`, `#terms-of-service-page`, `#contact-page`):**
        *   Standard static content pages for displaying legal information and contact details, each with a "Back to StoryAI" button.
        *   The Contact page includes a "Give Feedback" button that opens a feedback modal.

4.  **Side Panels (Slide-in):**
    *   **Story History Panel (`#story-history-panel`):** Slides in from the left.
        *   Header with "Search History" title, a "Delete History" button (leading to a detailed delete data modal), and a close button.
        *   A search bar to filter history.
        *   Content area displays past searches, grouped by "Today," "Yesterday," and "Older," with collapsible sections.
    *   **Prompt Library Panel (`#prompt-library-panel`):** Slides in from the right.
        *   Header with "Prompt Library" title, a close button, and a "Create prompt" button.
        *   A search bar to find prompts.
        *   Content area lists prompts under "My Personal Library" and "Recommended by Storytell." Each prompt item shows its title, creator, description, a "use" icon, and a "more options" (ellipsis) menu for actions like edit, delete, copy.

5.  **Modals & Popups:**
    *   **Story Progress Modal (`#story-progress-modal`):** Displays the steps in story generation with icons and status updates (e.g., Idea processing, Story writing, Plot points, Cast).
    *   **Prompt Modal (`#prompt-modal`):** Used for creating or editing prompts. Includes fields for Name, Description, Prompt text, and a "Save to" selector.
    *   **Delete Data Modal (`#delete-data-modal`):** Mimics browser "Clear browsing data" functionality. Has "Basic" and "Advanced" tabs, a time range selector, and checkboxes for various data types (browsing history, cookies, cached images, etc.).
    *   **Feedback Form Modal (`#feedback-form-modal`):** Allows users to send feedback with Subject and Message fields.
    *   **Feedback Popups (e.g., `#feedback-success-popup`, `#download-success-popup`, `#history-cleared-popup`, `#profile-updated-popup`, `#account-secured-popup`):** Small, centered popups with an icon (e.g., checkmark, shield), title, and message to confirm actions. They auto-dismiss.
    *   **Change Password OTP Modal (`#change-password-otp-modal`):** Guides the user through OTP verification and then setting a new password.
    *   **Sign Out Confirmation Popup (`#sign-out-confirm-popup`):** Asks for confirmation before signing the user out.
    *   All modals and panels have a blurred backdrop when active.

6.  **Footer:**
    *   Displays the copyright year and links to "Privacy Policy," "Terms of Service," and "Contact Us."

7.  **Interactivity & Styling:**
    *   The UI employs smooth transitions and animations for opening/closing modals, panels, and dropdowns.
    *   Hover states and focus indicators are clearly defined for interactive elements.
    *   Responsive design ensures usability across different screen sizes, with elements like side panels taking full width on smaller screens.

## How to Search for a Story

There are several ways to initiate a story search or view a story:

1.  **Main Story Idea Input (Idea Page):**
    *   Navigate to the **Idea Page** (this is the default starting page).
    *   In the "Choose a Category" dropdown, select a genre relevant to your story (e.g., "Fantasy Quest," "Sci-Fi Mystery").
    *   Locate the main input bar (styled like a Google search bar) with the placeholder "Describe your story idea here...".
    *   Type your story idea, concept, or keywords into this input bar.
    *   Click the **paper plane icon** (submit icon) to the right of the input bar, or press the **Enter** key.
    *   The application will then process your input and navigate to the **Story Page** to display the generated or retrieved story matching your idea and category.

2.  **Voice Search (Idea Page):**
    *   On the **Idea Page**, click the **microphone icon** located to the left of the story idea input bar.
    *   If prompted by your browser, grant permission for StoryAI to access your microphone.
    *   The microphone icon will become active, and the placeholder might change to "Listening...".
    *   Speak your story idea clearly. The recognized text will automatically populate the input bar.
    *   Once your idea is transcribed, click the **paper plane icon** or press **Enter** to submit.

3.  **Using Prompts from the Prompt Library:**
    *   Open the **Prompt Library**: Click the "Google Apps" icon in the header, then select "Prompt Library."
    *   Browse through "My Personal Library" (your saved prompts) or "Recommended by Storytell."
    *   Find a prompt you wish to use. You can use the search bar within the library to filter prompts.
    *   Click on the prompt's main details area, or click the **arrow icon** (Use prompt) associated with it.
    *   This action will automatically populate the story idea input bar on the **Idea Page** with the selected prompt's text.
    *   You can then modify the populated text if needed, choose a category, and submit it as described in point 1.

4.  **Revisiting from Story History:**
    *   Open the **Story History** panel: Click the "Google Apps" icon in the header, then select "History."
    *   Your past story searches/ideas will be listed, typically grouped by time (Today, Yesterday, Older).
    *   You can use the search bar within the history panel to find a specific past entry.
    *   Click on any history item (which includes the query and category).
    *   This will re-initiate the search using that historical query and category, taking you directly to the **Story Page** with the corresponding story.
